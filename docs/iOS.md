# Running LLaMA models on iOS

Check out the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/llm/llama-demo-ios.html) on how to build the iOS demo app running your
PyTorch models with [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch).

Once you can run the app on you device,
1 - connect the device to you Mac,
2 - copy the model and tokenizer.bin to the iOS Llama app
3 - select the tokenizer and model with the `(...)` control (bottom left of screen, to the left of the text entrybox)


Detailed step by step in conjunction with ExecuTorch iOS build, to run on
simulator for iOS.
