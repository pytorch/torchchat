# iOS

Open the iOS Llama Xcode project at
https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/LLaMA/LLaMA.xcodeproj
in Xcode and click Run.  You will need to provide a provisioning
profile (similar to what's expected for any iOS dev).

Once you can run the app on you device,
1 - connect the device to you Mac,
2 - copy the model and tokenizer.bin to the iOS Llama app
3 - select the tokenizer and model with the `(...)` control (bottom left of screen, to the left of the text entrybox)


Detailed step by step in conjunction with ET iOS build, to run on
simulator for iOS.
