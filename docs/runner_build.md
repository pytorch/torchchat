# Native Execution

While Python offers a great environment for training models and experimentation and research with models, developers
often are looking to use a native execution environment, either to achieve a certain performance level, or when
including a Python is undesirable (e.g., in a game application that wants to use an LLM for user interaction) or impossible (devices
with limited functionality and memory capacity).

The 'llama runner' is a native standalone application capable of running a model exported and compiled ahead-of-time with either Executorch (ET) or AOT Inductor (AOTI). Which model format to use depends on your requirements and preferences.  Executorch modelsare optimized for portability across a range of decices, including mobile and edge devices.  AOT Inductor models are optimized for a particular target architecture, which may result in better performance and efficiency.

Building the runners is straightforward with the included cmake build files and is covered in the next sections.  We will showcase the runners using ~~stories15M~~ llama2 7B and llama3.

## What can you do with torchchat's llama runner for native execution?

* Run models natively:
  * [Chat](#chat)
  * [Generate](#generate)
  * ~~[Run via Browser](#browser)~~
* [Building and using llama runner for exported .so files](#run-server)
     * in Chat mode
     * in Generate mode
* [Building and using llama runner for exported .pe files](#run-portable)
     * in Chat mode
     * in Generate mode
* [Building and using llama runner on mobile devices](#run-mobile)
* Appendix:
      * [Tokenizers](#tokenizers)
      * [Validation](#validation)


The runners accept the following command-line arguments:

```
Options:
  -t <float>  temperature in [0,inf], default 1.0
  -p <float>  p value in top-p (nucleus) sampling in [0,1], default 0.9
  -s <int>    random seed, default time(NULL)
  -n <int>    number of steps to run for, default 256. 0 = max_seq_len
  -i <string> input prompt
  -z <string> path to tokenizer
  -m <string> mode: generate|chat, default: generate
  -y <string> (optional) system prompt in chat mode
  -v <int>    (optional) vocab size, default is model-specific.
  -l <int>    (optional) llama version (2 or 3), default 2.
```

## Building and running runner-aoti
To build runner-aoti, run the following commands *from the torchchat root directory*

```
./scripts/build_native.sh aoti
```

After running these, the runner-aoti binary is located at ./cmake-out/aoti_run.

Let us try using it with an example.
We first download stories15M and export it to AOTI.

```
python3 torchchat.py download stories15M
python3 torchchat.py export stories15M --output-dso-path ./model.so
```

We can now execute the runner with:

```
wget -O ./tokenizer.bin https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/raw/master/tokenizer.bin
./cmake-out/aoti_run ./model.so -z ./tokenizer.bin -l 2 -i "Once upon a time"
```

The `-l 2` indicates that the model and tokenizer use the llama2 architecture.  If your model is based on llama3, use `-l 3`.

## Building and running runner-et
Before building runner-et, you must first setup ExecuTorch by following [setup ExecuTorch steps](executorch_setup.md).


To build runner-et, run the following commands *from the torchchat root directory*

```
./scripts/build_native.sh et
```

Note: the above script will wipe ./et-build if present and re-install ExecuTorch to ./et-build, which can take a while.  If you already installed ExecuTorch, running the commands below will build the runner, without re-installing ExecuTorch from source:

```
# Pull submodules (re2, abseil) for Tiktoken
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init

export TORCHCHAT_ROOT=${PWD}
cmake -S . -B ./cmake-out -G Ninja
cmake --build ./cmake-out --target et_run
```

After running these, the runner-et binary is located at ./cmake-out/et_run.

Let us try using it with an example.
We first download stories15M and export it to ExecuTorch.

```
python3 torchchat.py download stories15M
python3 torchchat.py export stories15M --output-pte-path ./model.pte
```

We can now execute the runner with:

```
wget -O ./tokenizer.bin https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/raw/master/tokenizer.bin
./cmake-out/et_run ./model.pte -z ./tokenizer.bin -l 2 -i "Once upon a time"
```

The `-l 2` indicates that the model and tokenizer use the llama2 architecture.  If your model is based on llama3, use `-l 3`.

## Appendix: Llama runner tokenizers

Tokenizers are essential tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that convert text into smaller units, such as words or phrases, known as tokens. Two popular tokenizers are SentencePiece and Tiktoken. [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for Neural Network-based text generation systems where the vocabulary size is predetermined prior to the neural model training. Llama2-style models typically use the SentencePiece tokenizer. Tiktoken is a newer tokenizer originally developed by OpenAI that allows you to see how many tokens a text string will use without making an API call. Llama3 uses the Tiktoken tokenizer.
 Torchchat includes both Python and C/C++ implementations of both the SentencePiece and Tiktoken tokenizers that may be used with the Python and native execution environments, respectively.

The SentencePiece tokenizer implementations for Python (developed by Google) and the C/C++ implementation (developed by Andrej Karpathy) use different input formats.  The Python implementation reads a tokenizer specification in `tokenizer.model` format.  The C/C++ tokenizer that reads the tokenizer instructions from a file in `tokenizer.bin` format.  We include Andrej's SentencePiece converter which translates a SentencePiece tokenizer in `tokenizer.model` format to `tokenizer.bin` in the utils subdirectory:
```
python3 utils/tokenizer.py --tokenizer-model=${MODEL_DIR}/tokenizer.model
```

## Appendix: Native model verification using the Python environment

After exporting a model, you will want to verify that the model delivers output of high quality, and works as expected.
Both can be achieved with the Python environment.  All torchchat Python comands can work with exported models.  Instead of loading the model from a checkpoint or GGUF file, use the the `--dso-path model.so` and `--pte-path model.pte` for loading both types of exported models. This enables you to verify the quality of the exported models, and run any tests that you may have developed in conjunction with exported models to enable you to validate model quality.

The `eval` tool evaluates model quality using metrics such as 'perplexity' that are commonly used in the NLP community to evaluate output quality.  Load your model exported model to evaluate quality metrics for exported models.  You can find an introduction to the eval tool in the [README](../README.md) file.

The `generate`, `chat` and `browser` tools enable you to verify that the exported model works correctly, as a debugging aid if you are developing your own native execution environment based on the llama runner provided with torchchat.
