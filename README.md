[skip default]: end

__Python Inference__ (chat, generate, browser, server)
* These commands represent different flavors of performing model inference in a Python enviroment.
* Models are constructed either from CLI args or from loading exported artifacts.

__Exporting__ (export)
* This command generates model artifacts that are consumed by Python Inference or Native Runners.
* More information is provided in the [AOT Inductor](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat?tab=readme-ov-file#aoti-aot-inductor) and [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat?tab=readme-ov-file#export-for-mobile) sections.

__Inventory Management__ (download, list, remove, where)
* These commands are used to manage and download models.
* More information is provided in the [Download Weights](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat?tab=readme-ov-file#download-weights) section.

__Evaluation__ (eval)
* This command test model fidelity via EleutherAI's [lm_evaluation_harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).
* More information is provided in the [Evaluation](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat?tab=readme-ov-file#eval) section.


## Download Weights
Most models use Hugging Face as the distribution channel, so you will need to create a Hugging Face account.
Create a Hugging Face user access token [as documented here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) with the `write` role.

Log into Hugging Face:

[prefix default]: HF_TOKEN="${SECRET_HF_TOKEN_PERIODIC}"

```
huggingface-cli login
```

Once this is done, torchchat will be able to download model artifacts from
Hugging Face.

```
python3 torchchat.py download llama3.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command may prompt you to request access to Llama 3 via
> Hugging Face, if you do not already have access. Simply follow the
> prompts and re-run the command when access is granted.*

More information about these commands can be found by adding the `--help` option.

</details>


## Running via PyTorch / Python

The simplest way to run a model in PyTorch is via [eager execution](https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-production-pytorch-performance-with-graph-transformations/).
This is the default execution mode for both PyTorch and torchchat. It performs inference
without creating exporting artifacts or using a separate runner.

The model used for inference can also be configured and tailored to specific needs
(compilation, quantization, etc.). See the [customization guide](docs/model_customization.md) for the options supported by torchchat.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about these commands, please refer to the `--help` menu.

### Chat
This mode allows you to chat with an LLM in an interactive fashion.

[skip default]: begin
```bash
python3 torchchat.py chat llama3.1
```
[skip default]: end

### Generate
This mode generates text based on an input prompt.
```bash
python3 torchchat.py generate llama3.1 --prompt "write me a story about a boy and his bear"
```

[skip default]: end

### Server
**Note: This feature is still a work in progress and not all endpoints are working**


<details>
<summary>This mode gives a REST API that matches the OpenAI API spec for interacting with a model</summary>

The server follows the [OpenAI API specification](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) for chat completions.
Since this feature is under active development, not every parameter is consumed. See api/api.py for details on
which request parameters are implemented. If you encounter any issues, please comment on the [tracking Github issue](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat/issues/973).

To test out the REST API, **you'll need 2 terminals**: one to host the server, and one to send the request.

In one terminal, start the server

[skip default]: begin

```bash
python3 torchchat.py server llama3.1
```
[skip default]: end

In another terminal, query the server using `curl`. Depending on the model configuration, this query might take a few minutes to respond.

Setting `stream` to "true" in the request emits a response in chunks. If `stream` is unset or not "true", then the client will await the full response from the server.


**Example Input + Output**

[skip default]: begin

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama3.1",
    "stream": "true",
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
```

```

[skip default]: end


</details>

### Browser
This command opens a basic browser interface for local chat by querying a local server.

First, follow the steps in the Server section above to start a local server. Then, in another terminal, launch the interface. Running the following will open a tab in your browser.

[skip default]: begin

```
streamlit run torchchat/usages/browser.py
```

Use the "Max Response Tokens" slider to limit the maximum number of tokens generated by the model for each response. Click the "Reset Chat" button to remove the message history and start a fresh chat.


## Desktop/Server Execution

### AOTI (AOT Inductor)
[AOTI](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-2/) compiles models before execution for faster inference. The process creates a [DSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_library) model (represented by a file with extension `.so`)
that is then loaded for inference. This can be done with both Python and C++ enviroments.

The following example exports and executes the Llama3.1 8B Instruct
model.  The first command compiles and performs the actual export.
```
python3 torchchat.py export llama3.1 --output-dso-path exportedModels/llama3.1.so
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your machine has cuda add this flag for performance
`--quantize config/data/cuda.json` when exporting.

For more details on quantization and what settings to use for your use
case visit our [customization guide](docs/model_customization.md).

### Run in a Python Enviroment

To run in a python enviroment, use the generate subcommand like before, but include the dso file.

```
python3 torchchat.py generate llama3.1 --dso-path exportedModels/llama3.1.so --prompt "Hello my name is"
```
**Note:** Depending on which accelerator is used to generate the .dso file, the command may need the device specified: `--device (cuda | cpu)`.


### Run using our C++ Runner

To run in a C++ enviroment, we need to build the runner binary.
```bash
scripts/build_native.sh aoti
```

Then run the compiled executable, with the exported DSO from earlier.
```bash
cmake-out/aoti_run exportedModels/llama3.1.so -z `python3 torchchat.py where llama3.1`/tokenizer.model -l 3 -i "Once upon a time"
```
**Note:** Depending on which accelerator is used to generate the .dso file, the runner may need the device specified: `-d (CUDA | CPU)`.

## Mobile Execution

[ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch) enables you to optimize your model for execution on a
mobile or embedded device.

### Set Up ExecuTorch

Before running any commands in torchchat that require ExecuTorch, you
must first install ExecuTorch.

To install ExecuTorch, run the following commands.  This will download the
ExecuTorch repo to ./et-build/src and install various ExecuTorch libraries to
./et-build/install.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following commands should be run from the torchchat root directory.

```
export TORCHCHAT_ROOT=${PWD}
./scripts/install_et.sh
```


### Export for mobile
Similar to AOTI, to deploy onto device, we first export the PTE artifact, then we load the artifact for inference.

The following example uses the Llama3.1 8B Instruct model.
```
# Export
python3 torchchat.py export llama3.1 --quantize config/data/mobile.json --output-pte-path llama3.1.pte
```

> [!NOTE]
> We use `--quantize config/data/mobile.json` to quantize the
llama3.1 model to reduce model size and improve performance for
on-device use cases.

For more details on quantization and what settings to use for your use
case visit our [customization guide](docs/model_customization.md).

### Deploy and run on Desktop

While ExecuTorch does not focus on desktop inference, it is capable
of doing so. This is handy for testing out PTE
models without sending them to a physical device.

Specifically there are 2 ways of doing so: Pure Python and via a Runner

<details>
<summary>Deploying via Python</summary>

```
# Execute
python3 torchchat.py generate llama3.1 --device cpu --pte-path llama3.1.pte --prompt "Hello my name is"
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Deploying via a Runner</summary>

Build the runner
```bash
scripts/build_native.sh et
```

Execute using the runner
```bash
cmake-out/et_run llama3.1.pte -z `python3 torchchat.py where llama3.1`/tokenizer.model -l 3 -i "Once upon a time"
```

</details>


[end default]: end

### Deploy and run on iOS

The following assumes you've completed the steps for [Setting up ExecuTorch](#set-up-executorch).

<details>
<summary>Deploying with Xcode</summary>

#### Requirements
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12/) 15.0 or later
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.19 or later
  - Download and open the macOS `.dmg` installer and move the Cmake app to `/Applications` folder.
  - Install Cmake command line tools: `sudo /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install`
- A development provisioning profile with the [`increased-memory-limit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_kernel_increased-memory-limit) entitlement.


#### Steps

1. Open the Xcode project:
    ```bash
    open et-build/src/executorch/examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/LLaMA/LLaMA.xcodeproj
    ```

    > Note: If you're running into any issues related to package dependencies, close Xcode, clean some of the caches and/or the build products, and open the Xcode project again:
    > ```bash
    > rm -rf \
    >   ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm \
    >   ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm \
    >   ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode \
    >   ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
    > ```
2. Click the Play button to launch the app in the Simulator.

3. To run on a device, ensure you have it set up for development and a provisioning profile with the `increased-memory-limit` entitlement. Update the app's bundle identifier to match your provisioning profile with the required capability.

4. After successfully launching the app, copy the exported ExecuTorch model (`.pte`) and tokenizer (`.model`) files to the iLLaMA folder. You can find the model file called `llama3.1.pte` in the current `torchchat` directory and the tokenizer file at `$(python3 torchchat.py where llama3.1)/tokenizer.model` path.

    - **For the Simulator:** Drag and drop both files onto the Simulator window and save them in the `On My iPhone > iLLaMA` folder.
    - **For a device:** Open a separate Finder window, navigate to the Files tab, drag and drop both files into the iLLaMA folder, and wait for the copying to finish.

5. Follow the app's UI guidelines to select the model and tokenizer files from the local filesystem and issue a prompt.

</a>
</p>
</details>


### Deploy and run on Android

The following assumes you've completed the steps for [Setting up ExecuTorch](#set-up-executorch).

<details>
<summary>Approach 1 (Recommended): Android Studio</summary>

#### Requirements
- Android Studio
- [Java 17](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks)
- [Android SDK 34](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/setup-sdk)
- [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb)


#### Steps

1. Download the AAR file, which contains the Java library and corresponding JNI library, to build and run the app.

   - [executorch-llama-tiktoken-rc3-0719.aar](https://ossci-android.s3.amazonaws.com/executorch/main/executorch-llama-tiktoken-rc3-0719.aar) (SHASUM: c3e5d2a97708f033c2b1839a89f12f737e3bbbef)

2. Rename the downloaded AAR file to `executorch.aar` and move the file to `torchchat/edge/android/torchchat/app/libs/`. You may need to create directory `torchchat/edge/android/torchchat/app/libs/` if it does not exist.

3. Push the model and tokenizer file to your device. You can find the model file called `llama3.1.pte` in the current `torchchat` directory and the tokenizer file at `$(python3 torchchat.py where llama3.1)/tokenizer.model` path.
    ```
    adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/llama
    adb push <model.pte> /data/local/tmp/llama
    adb push <tokenizer.model or tokenizer.bin> /data/local/tmp/llama
    ```

4. Use Android Studio to open the torchchat app skeleton, located at `torchchat/edge/android/torchchat`.

5. Click the Play button (^R) to launch it to emulator/device.

    - We recommend using a device with at least 12GB RAM and 20GB storage.
    - If using an emulated device, refer to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45517553/cant-change-the-ram-size-in-avd-manager-android-studio) on how to set the RAM.

6. Follow the app's UI guidelines to pick the model and tokenizer files from the local filesystem. Then issue a prompt.

**Note:** The AAR file listed in Step 1 has the tiktoken tokenizer, which is used for Llama 3. To tweak or use a custom tokenizer and runtime, modify the ExecuTorch code
and use [this script](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/build/build_android_llm_demo.sh) to build the AAR library. For convenience, we also provide an AAR
for sentencepiece tokenizer (e.g. Llama 2): [executorch-llama-bpe-rc3-0719.aar](https://ossci-android.s3.amazonaws.com/executorch/main/executorch-llama-bpe-rc3-0719.aar) (SHASUM: d5fe81d9a4700c36b50ae322e6bf34882134edb0)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/_static/img/android_llama_app.png" width="600" alt="Android app running a LlaMA model">
</p>



</details>
<details>
<summary>Approach 2: E2E Script</summary>

Alternatively, you can run `scripts/android_example.sh` which sets up Java, Android SDK Manager, Android SDK, Android emulator (if no physical device is found), builds the app, and launches it for you. It can be used if you don't have a GUI.

```
export TORCHCHAT_ROOT=$(pwd)
export USE_TIKTOKEN=ON # Set this only for tiktoken tokenizer
sh scripts/android_example.sh
```

</details>

## Eval

**Note: This feature is still a work in progress and not all features are working**

Uses the lm_eval library to evaluate model accuracy on a variety of
tasks. Defaults to wikitext and can be manually controlled using the
tasks and limit args. See [Evaluation](docs/evaluation.md)

**Examples**

Eager mode:
```
python3 torchchat.py eval llama3.1 --dtype fp32 --limit 5
```

To test the perplexity for a lowered or quantized model, pass it in
the same way you would to generate:

```
python3 torchchat.py eval llama3.1 --pte-path llama3.1.pte --limit 5
```

you can perform the example commands with any of these models.


## Design Principles

torchchat embodies PyTorch’s design philosophy [details](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/community/design.html), especially "usability over everything else".

### Native PyTorch

torchchat is a native-PyTorch library. While we provide integrations with the surrounding ecosystem (eg: Hugging Face models, etc), all of the core functionality is written in PyTorch.

### Simplicity and Extensibility

torchchat is designed to be easy to understand, use and extend.

- Composition over implementation inheritance - layers of inheritance for code re-use makes the code hard to read and extend
- No training frameworks - explicitly outlining the training logic makes it easy to extend for custom use cases
- Code duplication is preferred over unnecessary abstractions
- Modular building blocks over monolithic components

### Correctness

torchchat provides well-tested components with a high-bar on correctness.
We provide

- Extensive unit-tests to ensure things operate as they should

## Community Contributions

We really value our community and the contributions made by our wonderful users. We'll use this section to call out some of these contributions! If you'd like to help out as well, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

A section of commonly encountered setup errors/exceptions. If this section doesn't contain your situation, check the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat/issues)

### Model Access

**Access to model is restricted and you are not in the authorized list**

Some models require an additional step to access. Follow the
link provided in the error to get access.

### Installing ExecuTorch

**Failed Building Wheel**

If `./scripts/install_et.sh` fails with an error like `Building wheel for executorch (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully` It's possible that it's linking to an older version of pytorch installed some other way like via homebrew. You can break the link by uninstalling other versions such as `brew uninstall pytorch` Note: You may break something that depends on this, so be aware.

**CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED**

Run `pip install --upgrade certifi`.

## Filing Issues

If you encounter bugs or difficulty using torchchat, please file an GitHub [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat/issues).

Please include the exact command you ran and the output of that command.
Also, run this script and include the output saved to `system_info.txt` so that we can better debug your issue.

```

  Huamin Li and Mu-Chu Li who built the first version of nanogpt (`DSOGPT`)
  with AOT Inductor proving that AOTI can be used to build efficient
  LLMs, and DSOs are a viable distribution format for models.
  [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).

* Bert Maher and his
  [llama2.so](https://github.com/bertmaher/llama2.so), which built on
  Andrej's llama2.c and on DSOGPT to close the loop on Llama models
  with AOTInductor.

* Christian Puhrsch, Horace He, Joe Isaacson and many more for their
  many contributions in Accelerating GenAI models in the *"Anything,
  Fast!"* pytorch.org blogs, and, in particular, Horace He for [GPT,
  Fast!](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast), which we have
  directly adopted (both ideas and code) from his repo.
